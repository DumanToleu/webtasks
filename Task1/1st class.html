            <td>The BMW E53 is the first-generation BMW X5 mid-sized luxury crossover SUV. It was produced from 1999-2006[2] and was replaced by
                the BMW E70. The E53 was developed at a time when BMW still owned Land Rover and as such shares many components and designs with
                both the Land Rover Range Rover L322 model (specifically the Hill Descent System and Off Road Engine Management system) and the
                BMW E39 5 Series (specifically engines and electronic systems). The entire in-car entertainment system (Radio Function,
                Navigation System, Television and Telecommunications systems) are shared with other BMWs and L322.

                Porsche with four doors. Since 2008, all engines have featured direct injection technology.</td>
